# YoYo-kernel
YoYo - operating system for ARM processors. The basic and primary testing platform is Raspberry PI with max level of expansion(Ethernet, WiFi, etc.). Our next testing platforms are asus tinker board, beagle bone, etc. We try to do "PC with ARMs" era, and why we think that we can commercially succeed? We think that way because the YoYo will provide and maintain 100% compatibility with currently existing Windows applications! The kernel of YoYo itself will be very light, monolithic and unix-like designed. We will be developing very comfortable for programming GUI subsystem based on Java and XML.
